### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Jack. Iâ€™m an M.S. student in Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. Chengxiang Zhai and Prof. Heng Ji in the Blender NLP Lab. At the core of my research in usable and reliable intelligence, I strive to equip machines with interactive communications and up-to-date knowledge using explainable methods. The ultimate aim of my research is to promote engagement and truthfulness in information access and generation, through a variety of explainable methods with low bias, easy evaluation methods and high computational efficiency.

Bio: Jack Bai is an M.S. student in Computer Science at UIUC, working as the Research Assistant of Prof. Chengxiang Zhai on interactive knowledge acquisition, co-advised by Prof. Heng Ji. Before masterâ€™s, he obtained a dual degree from Zhejiang University and UIUC in Computer Engineering. He was a research intern at Microsoft Research, working on incident root cause prediction using LM with Dr. Shilin He, and a member of the UIUC Alexa ChatBot team researching Internet search query generation. He was also a research intern working on distributed LM training with Prof. Volodymyr Kindtatenko at NCSA. Except experience mentioned above, his work also reflects interests in financial time series prediction, code generation, open-domain QA, software frameworks for deep learning, etc.
