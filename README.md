### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, there! Iâ€™m Jack. Iâ€™m an MSCS student at UIUC advised by Prof. Nan Jiang, and a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley advised by Prof. Sergey Levine. Iâ€™m fully devoted to autonomous intelligence upon two levels: (1) I study representation learning for foundation models in order to interpret their behaviors. (2) I study reinforcement learning algorithms for foudation models based on the so-derived understandings.

Previously, I was a visiting scholar of Prof. Yi Ma, and was a research assistant of Prof. Heng Ji and Prof. Chengxiang Zhai. Before masterâ€™s, I obtained a dual degree from Zhejiang University and UIUC in Computer Engineering. During those wonderful years, I interned at Microsoft Research (Asia) advised by Dr. Shilin He.
